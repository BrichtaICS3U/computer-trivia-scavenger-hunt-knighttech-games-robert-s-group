06 AJ  ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator Analyzer and Computer) was a giant computer with 17,468 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 1,500 relays, and 6,000 manual switches. It took 18 months to build. It was built in 1945. it costed $500 000.


07 RB Ada Byron (AKA Ada Lovelace) wrote the first computer program, which computed Bernoulli numbers.


08 OB
Intel uses purified Silicon ingots sliced into discs called for their wafers.

09 AJ Cleanroom technicians must wear "bunny suits" while making computer chips. These suits keep contaminants away from the chips.


10 RB A modulator-demodulator (otherwise known as a modem) is a device that allows a computer to transmit data over long distances.


11 OB
bit = binary digit
8 bits = byte
2 nibbles = byte
An adjective used to describe hardware, denotes willingness to compute or pass data in either big-endian or little-endian format (depending, presumably, on a mode bit somewhere)
kilobyte = 1000 bytes
megabyte = 1000 kilobytes
gigabyte = 1000 megabytes
terabyte = 1000 gigabytes

15 AJ A USB flash drive is an external flash drive, small enough to carry on a key ring, that can be used with any computer that has a USB port.
An example for a use of one is for sharing data between computers.

16 RB 700 MB. The largest form of storage is a portable media player, which has at least 1TB of storage. USBs are, however, getting close, with one model approaching 1TB of storage.


17 OB 
the computer mouse, windows, shared-screen teleconferencing, hypermedia, groupware, and more.

18 AJ A computer virus is a program designed to spread itself by first infecting executable files or the system areas of hard and floppy disks and then making copies of itself.  Viruses usually operate without the knowledge or desire of the computer user.


19 RB Keyboard, monitor, speaker.


20 OB

21 AJ A dvorak keyboard is an alternate way of arranging the keys on the keyboard. They are arranged in order of how often the letters are used. An advandatge to this is that is may reduce injuries such as wrist pain and carpal tunnel.


22 RB He invented the microprocessor, a device that shrunk the size of the average computer.
